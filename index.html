<h1>An all encompassing essay on <a href="BELOW.html">"The Ocean"</a>.</h1>
<b>
    <a href="BELOW.html">"The Ocean"</a> is a film recorded and published in 2007. It quickly became a worldwide sensation as it had no words, no letters, and no disconnect between cultures. Every single person on the earth could understand what <a href="BELOW.html">"The Ocean"</a>  was trying to convey, yet no one could explain it. There was simply no word nor language fit to explain it. That is what I am trying to do today. I will do my very best to explain the meaning behind <a href="BELOW.html">"The Ocean"</a> , and not just the meaning, but also the feeling, the struggles, the good, and the bad. Join me on this adventure as the indescribable becomes <a href="The__Ocean.mp3"><mark>describable.</mark></a>
