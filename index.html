<h1>An all encompassing essay on "The Ocean".</h1>
<b>
    "The Ocean" is a film recorded and published in 2007. It quickly became a worldwide sensation as it had no words, no letters, and no disconnect between cultures. Every single person on the earth could understand what "The Ocean" was trying to convey, yet no one could explain it. There was simply no word nor language fit to explain it. That is what I am trying to do today. I will do my very best to explain the meaning behind "The Ocean," and not just the meaning, but also the feeling, the struggles, the good, and the bad. Join me on this adventure as the indescribable becomes <a href="The__Ocean.mp3"><mark>describable.</mark></a> <
